<h1> Introduction</h1>
	<p>I'm a relatively pretty funny Jewish guy, currently purusing a career in marketing.  I would like to eventually work my way up at a studio or agency, and also become more funny.  Lofty goals, I know.  I'm 23 years old and living in Los Angeles.  Anyways, that's me I guess.

<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
	<p> I'm from Oak Park, California.  It's not a very exciting town, but it's right outside of Los Angeles and it's prety cool!

<h1> What Are My Hobbies</h1>
	<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>I really enjoy going to concerts, and playing music as well.  I've been a musician for the past couple of years so I always enjoy getting to play it.</p>
	<h2>Technology</h2>
		<p>I'm fascinated as to where we're going with technology.  I feel that we really are developing quickly as a society through the use of technology, so for me better understanding the means as to where we're going is fascinating to me.</p>
	<h2>Drinking</h2>
		<p>I do occassionally enjoy a beer or two.</p>
